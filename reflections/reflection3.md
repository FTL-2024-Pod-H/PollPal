## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 succesfully split up work to fix bugs found in this week's Bug Bash

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Getting render to fetch updates we make to our Main branch

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, everything in our original sprint plan was finished. However, new tasks were added to the sprint plan after the Bug Bash; the majority of those were done.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes. Not technical but feedback from instructors and mentors were incredibly helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A feature considered "at risk" would be implementing user notifications. If this remains "at risk", we'll consider pushing it to the next version of our app.
