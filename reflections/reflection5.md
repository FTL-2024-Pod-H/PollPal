## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)
  - We would say it was just right, we had enough time to complete our MVP but if we had more time we could have done a lot more.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?
  - Within our plan, we wanted to implement more stretch features, realizing we wouldnt have time to do so we had to push hem to be apart of PollPal 2.0. If we were starting over, we would most likey take the same approach.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?
  - We think that all the labs and weekly assignments were helpful in creating a lot of the functionality of our website.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)
  - The instructors were very helpful, the mentors gave us a lot of feedback and helped us find bugs. The bug bash was helpful as well as all of the practice presentations every friday and the practice demo day.
