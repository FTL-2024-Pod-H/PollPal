# Reflection #2

Pod Members: **Kiahna Isadore, Lucky Beulla Muhoza, Samuel Rebuelta-Sanchez, Hanna Abrahem**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
  - We fully completed our MVP

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Implementing Pagination for Forum, Google Authentication, organizing data retrieved from APIs

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Not all, but for the next sprint, we plan on dedicating time solely for CSS/styling the app as well as testing every feature to find bugs.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes! Google Maps and  Open AI APIs video walkthroughs,

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Appp crashes when a user wants to access "Polling Locations" while there are no locations to display. We need to implement a way where the app lets the user know there are now locations available instead of the app crashing.
