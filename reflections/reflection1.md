## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Completing Sprint 1 Tasks. Also, the ability to put together one product after working on tasks individually

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Coming to a concensus about the app's overall visual appearance and organizing data fetched from API's (Google Civic Information API)

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Most tasks were completed, but had to pivot from original plans on some tasks. We will prioritize a task's functionaliy over its appearance

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes. Material UI, TailwindCSS, and uiverse.io were great resources provided by instructors and classmates in terms of app appearance.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Our "US Government Education" section (user story 1) can be considered 'at risk' due to the possibility of bias when providing government/political information.
